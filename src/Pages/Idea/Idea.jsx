              Fi-Mi’s ultimate goal is to provide an efficient system to reduce
              the consequences of air pollution, hence improve the quality of
              living. To fulfill this goal the Fi-Mi team have identified the
              key objectives of the project as follows:
            </div>
            <div className="objectives_content_details">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To design a mobile air monitoring platform following a
                  three-tier architecture that well defines the tiers’ roles and
                  interplay protocols between the tiers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To propose optimal algorithms, protocols for the related
                  optimization problems in each tier, relying on newly
                  introducing mathematical models for the tiers’ operations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To design and realize a cost-effective, high-accuracy air
                  quality monitoring device.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To propose novel deep learning models that accurately predict
                  air quality in both the spatial (un-monitoring regions) and
                  temporal (the future) domains.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To construct a publicly available, normalized database of air
                  quality information that aims to facilitate the related
                  researches.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To build a publicly available API library for analyzing and
                  forecasting air quality.
                </li>
                <li>To deploy a testbed of the Fi-Mi system in Hanoi.</li>
                <li>
                  To provide a Fi-Mi’s user interface (including a smartphone
                  application and a web portal) that allows people to access the
                  real-time fine-grained information of air quality in Hanoi.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div> */}
